"""
Linux Popup Host
=================

Owns everything about the popup window that is specific to Linux: the GTK
window handle behind pywebview, opacity-based invisibility while the content
is measured, work-area anchoring, dismissal on focus loss or Escape, and the
pinned-popup drag.

Four properties of the GTK backend shape this module, and each one is silent
when violated - every pywebview call still reports success:

* ``Window.show()`` does not map a window created with ``hidden=True``.  The
  GTK window must be mapped through ``show_all()`` and ``present()``.
* A position set before the window is mapped is discarded, and the compositor
  then places the window by its own policy.  The move must follow the map.
* Without forced focus the compositor's focus-stealing prevention leaves a
  frameless keep-above window unfocused, so ``focus-out-event`` never fires
  and the popup could never dismiss itself.
* GTK signal handlers run on the main loop, and pywebview's calls wait for
  that same loop - calling one from a handler deadlocks the whole session.
